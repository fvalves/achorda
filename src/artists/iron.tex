{\nolyrics Intro:  \[Dm]  \[B&] \[C]  \[B&] \[C] \[Dm]}
\endverse  

\beginverse
\[Dm]I am a \[B&]man who walks a\[C]lone, and when I'm \[B&]walking \[C]a dark \[Dm]road  
at night or \[B&]strolling through the \[C]park \[B&] \[C]
\[Dm]When the \[B&]lights begin to \[C]change, I sometimes \[F]feel a \[G]little \[Dm]strange  
a little \[B&]anxious when it's \[C]dark
\endverse

\beginchorus  
Fear of the \[B&]dark, \[C] Fear of the \[Dm]\[C]dark,  
I have a \[B&]constant fear that \[F]something's \[G]always \[Dm]near  
Fear of the \[B&]dark, \[C] Fear of the \[Dm]\[C]dark,  
I have a \[B&]phobia that \[F]someone's \[G]always \[Dm]there  
\endchorus   

\beginverse*
{\nolyrics \[Dm]\[B&]\[C]\[Dm]}
\endverse  

\beginverse
\[Dm]Have you run your \[B&]fingers down the wall  
And have you felt your neck skin \[C]crawl  
When you're searching for the \[Dm]light  
Sometimes when you're \[B&]scared to take a look  
At the corner of the \[C]room  
You've sensed that something's watching \[Dm]you
\endverse  

\Chorus

\beginverse
Have you ever \[B&]been alone at \[C]night  
Thought you \[Dm]heard \[C]footsteps \[Dm]behind  
And turned a\[B&]round and no one's \[C]there?  
\[Dm]And as you \[B&]quicken up your \[C]pace  
You find it \[F]hard to \[G]look \[Dm]again  
Because you're \[B&]sure there's someone \[C]there  
\endverse

\Chorus

\beginverse
\[Dm]Watching horror \[B&]films the night be\[C]fore  
Debating \[F]witches \[G]and folk\[Dm]lore  
The unknown \[B&]troubles on your \[C]mind  
\[Dm]Maybe your \[B&]mind is playing \[C]tricks  
You sense and \[F]sudden\[G]ly eyes \[Dm]fix  
On dancing \[B&]shadows from be\[C]hind

\beginsong{Wasted Years}[by={Iron Maiden}]
\beginverse*
{\nolyrics Intro: \[Em] \[D]}
\endverse

\beginverse
\memorize
From the \[Em]coast of gold, across the \[D]seven seas
I'm \[Em]travellin' on, \[D]far and wide
But \[C]now it seems, I'm just a \[Em]stranger to myself
And all the \[D]things I sometimes do, it \[C]isn't me but someone else
\endverse

\beginverse*
I ^close my eyes, and ^think of home
Another ^city goes by in the ^night
Ain't it ^funny how it is, you never ^miss it 'til it's gone away
And my ^heart is lying there and will ^be 'til my dying day
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]So \[C]\[A] under\[D]stand\[C]\[A] 
Don't \[Em]waste your time always \[D]searching for those \[C]wasted years
\[G]Face up \[C]\[A] make your \[D]stand\[C]\[A] 
And \[Em]realize you're \[D]living in the \[C]golden years
\endchorus

\beginverse*
^Too much time on my hands, I got you ^on my mind
Can't ^ease this pain, so ^easily
When you ^can't find the words to say it's hard to ^make it through another day
And it ^makes me wanna cry and throw my ^hands up to the sky
\endverse

\XChorus{2}

\beginverse
\[Dm]Hear them whisper,
\[F]voices \[C]from the other \[Dm]side
Hear them calling
former \[A]foes now friends are \[F]resting side by \[C]side

\[Dm]They will never
\[F]leave our \[C]hearts or fade \[Dm]away
live forever
they were \[A]far to young to \[F]die in such a \[C]way

\[Dm]how many \[B&]wasted lives
\[F]how many \[C]dreams did fade a\[Dm]way
broken \[B&]promises
they \[F]won\apos t be coming \[C]home

\[Gm]Oh mothers \[E&]wipe your tears
your \[B&]sons will rest a \[F]million years\[Gm] 
found their \[E&]peace at last
as \[B&]foe turned to \[F]friend
and \[C]forgave
And they \[B&]knew they\apos d die
\endverse

\beginchorus
Gallipo\[Dm]li
Left their \[C]letters in the \[Dm]sand
\[B&]Such waste of life
Gallipo\[Dm]li
Dreams of \[C]freedom turned to \[Dm]dust
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Hell is waiting ^where the ^ocean meets the ^sand
Cliffs of burden
where the ^soldiers rushed in^to a certain ^death

^At the shoreline
^Blood of ^heroes stains the ^land
light a candle
One for ^each of them who ^fought and died in ^vain

^There is no ^enemy
^There is no ^victory ^ 
Only ^boys who lost their ^lives in the ^sand

^Young men were ^sacrificed
Their ^names are carved in ^stone and kept a^live
and for^ever we will ^honour the ^memory of ^them
And they ^knew they would die
\endverse

\Chorus

\beginsong{The Price of a Mile}[by={Sabaton}]
\beginverse
Hear the \[Em]sound of a machinegun
Hear it \[Bm]echo in the night
\[G]Mortars firing rains the scene
\[Bm]Scars the fields that once were green

It\apos s a \[Em]stalemate at the frontline
Where the \[Bm]soldiers rest in mud
\[G]Roads and houses all is gone
\[Bm]There\apos s no glory to be won

Know that \[Em]many men will suffer
Know that \[D]many men will die
\[G]Half a million lives at stake
\[Bm]At the fields of Passchendaele

And as the the \[C]night falls the \[D]general calls
And the \[G]battle \[D]carries \[Em]on and \[C]on
What is the \[D]purpose of it \[Bm]all?
\[C]What\apos s the price of a \[D]mile?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Em]Thousands of feet march to the beat
It\apos s an \[Bm]army on the march
\[G]Long way from home
\[Bm]Paying the price in \[D]young mens lives

\[Em]Thousands of feet march to the beat
It\apos s an \[Bm]army in despair
\[G]Knee deep in mud
\[Bm]Stuck in a trench with no \[D] way out
{\nolyrics \[Em] }
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Thousand of machineguns
Kept on ^firing through the night
^Mortars blazed and wrecked the scene
^Gone the fields that once were green

Still a ^deadlock at the frontline
Where the ^soldiers die in mud
^Roads and houses since long gone
^Still no glory has been won

Know that ^many men have suffered
Know that ^many men have died
^6 miles of ground have been won
^Half a million men are gone

And as the ^men crawled the ^general called
And the ^killing ^carried ^on and ^on
What was the ^purpose of it ^all?
^What\apos s the price of a ^mile?
\endverse

\Chorus

\beginverse*
{\nolyrics \[Em] \[D] \[Em] \[D] }

\[Em]Young men are dying
\[D]They pay the price
\[Em]Oh how they suffer
\[Em]So tell me \[D]what\apos s the price of a \[G]mile

{\nolyrics (Guitar Solo) \[G] \[Bm] \[Em] \[Bm] \[C] \[D] \[G] \[Bm] \[Em] \[Bm] }

\[C]There\apos s no price for a \[D]mile!

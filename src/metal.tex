\beginsong{Cliffs of Gallipoli}[by={Sabaton}]
\beginverse
\[Dm]Hear them whisper,
\[F]voices \[C]from the other \[Dm]side
Hear them calling
former \[A]foes now friends are \[F]resting side by \[C]side

\[Dm]They will never
\[F]leave our \[C]hearts or fade \[Dm]away
live forever
they were \[A]far to young to \[F]die in such a \[C]way

\[Dm]how many \[B&]wasted lives
\[F]how many \[C]dreams did fade a\[Dm]way
broken \[B&]promises
they \[F]won’t be coming \[C]home

\[Gm]Oh mothers \[E&]wipe your tears
your \[B&]sons will rest a \[F]million years
\[Gm]found their \[E&]peace at last
as \[B&]foe turned to \[F]friend
and \[C]forgive
And they \[B&]knew they’d die
\endverse

\beginchorus
Gallipo\[Dm]li
Left their \[C]letters in the \[Dm]sand
\[B&]Such waste of life
Gallipo\[Dm]li
Dreams of freedom turned to \[Dm]dust
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Hell is waiting ^where the ocean meets the ^sand
Cliffs of burden
where the ^soldiers rushed in^to a certain ^death

^At the shoreline
^Blood of ^heroes stains the ^land
light a candle
One for ^each of them who ^fought and died in ^vain

^There is no ^enemy
^There is no ^victory ^ 
Only ^boys who ^lost their lives in the ^sand

^Young men were ^sacrificed
Their ^names are carved in ^stone and kept alive
and for^ever we will ^honour the memory of ^them
And they ^knew they would die
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Gm]Oh mothers \[E&]wipe your tears

And they \[B&]knew they\apos d die

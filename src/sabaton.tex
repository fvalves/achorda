\beginsong{Cliffs of Gallipoli}[by={Sabaton}]
\beginverse
\[Dm]Hear them whisper,
\[F]voices \[C]from the other \[Dm]side
Hear them calling
former \[A]foes now friends are \[F]resting side by \[C]side
\endverse

\beginverse
^They will never
^leave our ^hearts or fade ^away
live forever
they were ^far to young to ^die in such a ^way
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Dm]how many \[B&]wasted lives
\[F]how many \[C]dreams did fade a\[Dm]way
broken \[B&]promises
they \[F]won’t be coming \[C]home
\endverse

Oh mothers wipe your tears
your sons will rest a million years
found their peace at last
as foe turned to friend
and forgive
And they knew they’d die

[Chorus:]
Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust

Hell is waiting where the ocean meets the sand
Cliffs of burden
where the soldiers rushed into a certain death

At the shoreline
Blood of heroes stains the land
light a candle
One for each of them who fought and died in vain

There is no enemy
There is no victory
Only boys who lost their lives in the sand
Young men were sacrificed
Their names are carved in stone and kept alive
and forever we will honour the memory of them
And they knew they would die

[Chorus]

Oh mothers wipe your tears
your sons will rest a million years
found their peace at last
as foe turned to friend
and forgive
And they knew they would die

[Chorus]
